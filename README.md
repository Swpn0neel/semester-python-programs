1. If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23. Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.
2. By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.
3. Find the largest prime factor for a given positive integer.
4. A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009=91x99. Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit number.
5. 2520 is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the numbers from 1 to 10 without any remainder. Write a function to find the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers from 1 to 20?
6. Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first n natural numbers and the
square of the sum. Return the result as a tuple from your function. (n is your function’s
input).
7. Write a function to find the nth prime number. For example the 5th prime number is 11.
8. Find the thirteen adjacent digits in an n-digit number that have the greatest product. Return the value of this product, as well as the 13 adjacent digits as a tuple? The n digit number is your function’s input.
9. A Pythagorean triplet is a set of three natural numbers, a<b<c, for which, a2+b2=c2. There exists exactly one Pythagorean triplet for which a+b+c=1000. Find a, b, c and the product abc.
10. Find the sum of all the primes below n (where n is your function’s input).
